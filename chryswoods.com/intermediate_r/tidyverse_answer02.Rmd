According to [this page](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/MASS/cats.html)
the body weight is in kilograms and the heart weight is in grams. As is normal for
real-world data, there is little consistency in units...

```R
library(tidyverse)

cats <- read_csv("https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_r/data/cats.csv")

mean_heart_weight <- calculate_mean(cats$HeartWeight)
mean_body_weight <- calculate_mean(cats$BodyWeight)

max_heart_weight <- calculate_max(cats$HeartWeight)
max_body_weight <- calculate_max(cats$BodyWeight)

cat( sprintf("Heart Weight: mean = %.2f g, max = %.2f g\n", 
             mean_heart_weight, max_heart_weight) )

cat( sprintf("Body weight: mean = %.2f kg, max = %.2f kg\n",
             mean_body_weight, max_body_weight) )
```

should print

```
Heart Weight: mean = 10.63 g, max = 20.50 g
Body weight: mean = 2.72 kg, max = 3.90 kg
```
