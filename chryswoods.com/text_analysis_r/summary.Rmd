# Summary

This course has given you a brief introduction to the tools that can help you 
perform text and sentiment analysis. This has been only a brief introduction. 
You can learn more by reading this amazing online book;

* [Text mining with R: A Tidy approach, by Julia Silge and David Robinson](https://www.tidytextmining.com)

This book goes into a lot more detail than we could possibly go into
for a short workshop.
