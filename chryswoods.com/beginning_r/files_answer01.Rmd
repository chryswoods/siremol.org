```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file `data.txt`:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

We then write a short script to open the data file, loop over its 
lines and print each in-turn. The only thing that has been changed 
here is the argument being passed to `file`:

```R
lines <- readLines(file("data.txt"))

for (line in lines){
  cat(line, sep="\n")
}
```

```
Rscript file.R

```
