```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We make a list and then select a few slices of it:

```R
my_list <- c(3, 5, "green", 5.3, "house", 100, 1)

print(my_list[seq(2,4)])
print(my_list[seq(3,5)])
print(my_list[seq(1,1)])
print(my_list[seq(1,7,2)])
print(my_list[seq(7,1,-1)])
```

This selects everything from the number 2 index up to and including the number 4 index, 
i.e. the 2, 3 and 4 indexes:

```R
seq(2,4)
```

This starts at index 3 and goes as far as index 5:

```R
seq(3,5)
```

This starts at the beginning of the list and stops at index 1, 
giving us a list with just one item:

```R
seq(1,1)
```

This starts at index 1, and goes up to index 7 in steps of 2 
(so all the odd indexes)

```R
seq(1,7,2)
```

This starts at index 7 and goes down to index 1 in steps of -1
(thus reversing the list)

```R
seq(7,1,-1)
```
