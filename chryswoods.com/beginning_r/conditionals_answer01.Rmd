```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```R
my_number <- 74

if (my_number > 100){
    print(paste(my_number, "is large"))
}
```

If `my_number` is smaller than `100` then the expression is `FALSE` and 
so the `if` does not trigger and nothing is printed:

```
Rscript if.R
```
