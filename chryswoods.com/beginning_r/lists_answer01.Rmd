```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We have changed our list by adding two more items to the end of it. 
Each is still separated by a comma:

```R
my_list <- c("cat", "dog", 261, "hello", 5.76)

print(my_list)
```

```
RScript list.R

[1] "cat"   "dog"   "261"   "hello" "5.76" 
```

Here we edit our list so that the items are all in a different order:

```R
my_list <- c(261, "hello", 5.76, "cat", "dog")

print(my_list)
```

```
Rscript list.R

[1] "261"   "hello" "5.76"  "cat"   "dog"
```
