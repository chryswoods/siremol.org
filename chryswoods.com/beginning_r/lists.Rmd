## Lists

Until now all the variables we have used have contained a single piece 
of information, for example, `a <- 4` makes a variable `a` containing 
a single number, `4`. It’s very common in programming (and in fact real 
life) to want to refer to collections of this. For example a shopping 
list contains a list of items you want to buy, or a car park 
contains a set of cars.

Create a new file by going to *File → New File → R Script*. 
Save it (e.g. using *File → Save*) to a file called list.R. 
Inside that file write the following:

```R
my_list <- c("cat", "dog", 261)

print(my_list)
```

Run this script in the terminal with `Rscript list.R` and look at the output.

This will create a R list (also called a vector) with three elements and 
assign it to the variable `my_list`. The function `c` is the "combine" function that
"creates a list" from by combining its arguments. The elements of the list, like all
arguments to a function, are separated by commas. As with previous 
variable types, you can print lists by passing their name to the `print()` function.

You can have as many items in a list as you like, even zero items. 
An empty list could look like:

```R
my_list <- c()
```

And a list with six different numbers could look like:

```R
my_list <- c(32, 65, 3, 867, 3, -5)
```

## Indexing

The power of R's lists comes not simply from being able to hold many pieces 
of data but from being able to get specific pieces of data out. The primary 
method of this is called indexing. Indexing a list in R is done using the 
square brackets `[]`. To get a single element out of a list you write 
the name of the variable followed by a pair of square brackets with a 
single number between them:

```R
my_list <- c("cat", "dog", 261)

my_element <- my_list[1]

print(my_element)
```

The code `my_list[1]` means "give me the number 1 element of the list my_list". 
Run this code and see what you get. Is it what you expect?

You'll probably notice that it prints `cat` whereas those of you who've used
other programming languages may have expected it to print `dog`. 
This is because in R you count from one when indexing lists and 
so index 1 refers to the first item in the list. This is different to languages
like Python or C++, which count from 0. R instead counts from 1.
This "one-indexing" is not common and is not used by many programming languages.

## R NA

Indexing lists is likely the first time you will see an R `NA`. `NA` is short
for "not available", and is returned by R whenever you ask for something 
that is not available. This can happen when you ask for an item in a list
that doesn't exist. You can test if a value is `NA` using the `is.na` function.
For example;

```R
my_list <- c("cat", "dog", 261)

my_element <- my_list[6]

print(my_element)

print(is.na(my_element))
```

Running this you will see the following printed to the screen:

```
[1] NA
[1] TRUE
```

Be very careful in R that you check if values are `NA`. A common 
source of bugs is accessing elements in a list that don't exist.

You can get the length of the list using the `length` function, e.g.

```R
my_list <- c("cat", "dog", 261)

print(length(my_list))
```

A valid index in a list must be `1 <= index <= length(list)`.

## Slicing

As well as being able to select individual elements from a list, 
you can also grab sections of it at once. This process of asking 
for subsections of a list of called slicing. Slicing starts out 
the same way as standard indexing (i.e. with square brackets) 
but instead of putting a single number between them, you combine 
a collection (`c`) of numbers. For example;

```R
my_list <- c(3, 5, "green", 5.3, "house", 100, 1)

my_slice <- my_list[c(3,4,5)]

print(my_slice)
```

Run this code and look at the output.

You see that is printed `"green" "5.3" "house"` which is index 3 (`green`), 
index 4 (`5.3`) and index 5 (`house`), as you requested.

Writing out each index you want would be hard if you wanted a lot of values, 
e.g. slicing elements 5 to 50 of a big list. Fortunately, the `seq` function
generates sequences of numbers, e.g.

```R
my_list <- c(3, 5, "green", 5.3, "house", 100, 1)

my_slice <- my_list[seq(3,5)]

print(my_slice)
```

In this case, `seq(3,5)` generates the sequence of numbers from 3 to 5 
inclusive. It is thus the same as `c(3,4,5)`. You can add an optional
third argument to `seq` that gives the step, e.g. `seq(1,9,2)` will 
be the sequence of odd numbers between 1 and 9, while 
`seq(10,1,-1)` would be a countdown from 10 to 1.

## Adding things to lists

Lists in R are *static*, meaning that you can't change their size during 
your script. You can add items to the end of your list by using 
the `append` function, which adds to a copy:

```R
my_list <- c("cat", "dog")

my_list <- append(my_list, "horse")

print(my_list)

other_list <- c("fish", "zebra")

my_list <- append(my_list, other_list)

print(my_list)
```

Append takes two arguments; the list, and then
the item (or items) you want to append to the list. It appends the item(s) onto
a copy of the list, which is returned.

The combine (`c`) function does a very similar job to `append`, and
so you may see it used to append items too, e.g.

```R
my_list <- c("cat", "dog")

my_list <- c(my_list, "horse")

print(my_list)

other_list <- c("fish", "zebra")

my_list <- c(my_list, other_list)

print(my_list)
```

In my opinion, your code should be descriptive, and so describe the
intent of what you want to do. Thus, I recommend using `append` when
you want to append items onto the end of a list, and use
`c` only when you want to combine or create a collection.
