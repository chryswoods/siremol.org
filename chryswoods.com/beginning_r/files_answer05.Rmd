```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here we change the line of code in our script to have the string
`"The Battle of Hastings was in 1066"` instead of `"Hello from R"`.

```
print("The Battle of Hastings was in 1066")
```

When we run our changed script we see that it now prints our new 
string to the screen:

```
Rscript hello.R

[1] "The Battle of Hastings was in 1066"
```
