```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file data.txt:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

Here the loop itself has not changed, we've just created a new variable 
afterwards, `mean` which is calculated from `total` and `count`:

```R
lines <- readLines(file("data.txt"))

total <- 0
count <- 0

for (line in lines){
  number <- as.numeric(line)
  total <- total + number
  count <- count + 1
}

mean <- total / count

print(paste("Sum of all", count, "values is:", total))
print(paste("The mean is", mean))
```

```
Rscript file.R

[1] "Sum of all 7 values is: 460"
[1] "The mean is 65.7142857142857"
```
