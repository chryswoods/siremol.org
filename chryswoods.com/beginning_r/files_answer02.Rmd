```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file data.txt:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

We have changed just one line so that it now has `* 10` rather than `+ 17`:

```R
lines <- readLines(file("data.txt"))

for (line in lines){
  number <- as.numeric(line)
  new_number <- number * 10
  print(new_number)
}
```

```
Rscript file.R

[1] 120
[1] 540
[1] 70
[1] 3320
[1] 540
[1] 10
[1] 0
```
