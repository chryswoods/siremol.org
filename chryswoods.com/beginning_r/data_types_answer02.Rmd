```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We have moved the string out of the parentheses and into a named variable, 
`words`. We then pass this variable to the function:

```R
words <- "The Battle of Hastings was in 1066"

print(words)
```

When we run our script we see that the output has not changed, as expected:

```
Rscript hello.R

[1] "The Battle of Hastings was in 1066"
```
