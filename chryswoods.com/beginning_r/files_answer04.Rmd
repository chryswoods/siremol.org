```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Starting with creating our data file data.txt:

```
12
54
7
332
54
1
0
```

As before we start with defining a variable `count` to start at zero. 
We increase it by 1 each time around the loop and print it out at the end:

```R
lines <- readLines(file("data.txt"))

total <- 0
count <- 0

for (line in lines){
  number <- as.numeric(line)
  total <- total + number
  count <- count + 1
}

print(paste("Sum of all", count, "values is:", total))
```

```
Rscript file.R

[1] "Sum of all 7 values is: 460"
```
