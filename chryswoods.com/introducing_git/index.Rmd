Git is a version control system that allows you to save multiple versions of a file or directory. This is useful to allow you to keep a record of all changes made to a file, and to move backwards and forwards in time through different versions of your file.

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) is an example of a 
[version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system. 
There are many different version control systems, e.g. [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), 
[subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) and 
[mercurial]()https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial).

However, Git has risen to become almost the standard version control system with extremely high adoption and widespread use across academia, personal projects and industry. The [State of the Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com) gives a good idea of how widespread git has become. In my opinion, git is the right
choice for version control for all new projects.

Git was originally developed to manage version control for the source code of the Linux kernel
(Linux's and Git's creator, Linus Torvalds, jokes that he named git after himself). Despite starting as a tool
for programmers, it is now used to version control any kind of file, and is now widely used in academia
for a whole host of projects, e.g.

* Saving different versions of a paper or thesis
* Saving different versions of data in a study
* Saving different versions of analysis scripts
* Saving different versions of group documents, e.g. websites, agreements, wikis or collaboration documents

Git is free and open source, and there are [many](http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) 
[Git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) [tutorials](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Git/article.html) available.

This is a short workshop that aims to introduce you to version control using Git. At the end of this workshop you will know how to;

* Create a directory that will contain files that can be version controlled
* Save multiple versions of files
* Retrieve old versions of files
* Add, rename and delete version controlled files
* Back up you version controlled files to a cloud service such as GitHub
* Write markdown to describe your version controlled files

This workshop is a pre-requisite for our [Git for Collaboration](https://chryswoods.com/git_collaboration)
workshop, which will show you how you can use git to collaborate with and share files with others.

Please feel free to work through this workshop at your own pace. Git is best learned by using it, so
please copy out and play with the examples provided, and have a go at the exercises. Throughout this
workshop you will build up a "cheat sheet" of Git commands. These are summarised on the 
[summary](summary.html) page.
